StarlingPunk
============

##Branch Specific Stuff:
* Reworked layering system - Layering should work more like FP now (no more having to set things to 110!)
* SPSpritemap - A self contained class that juggles multiple movieClips for you. Acts like FP's Spritemap class but uses Texture Altases for better performance
* You can now get Entities by instance (just set that object's eName). Getting entities by Class will be supported soon.
* SPImage - Extremely basic at the moment, can only draw rectangles, circles and empty rectangles

###Update Version 1.5 Change Log
* added mouseX, mouseY and mouseWheelDelta support to SPInput

----------------------------------------------------------------

###Update Version 1.4 Change Log
* added Starling's new AssetManager class to SP for easy access
* updated to starling 1.3
* added behavior system
* laid ground work for debug console
* several performance optimizations partially when getting an entity's width/height

----------------------------------------------------------------

###Update Version 1.3 Change Log
 * created SPCamera class!!!!
 * added crazy experimental camera zoom and rotation abilities to platformer example
 * rebuilt SPTilesets to support massive amounts of tiles
 * SP class now has elapsedTime variable to write framerate independent code
 * fixed bug in SPWorld removeAll class so it actually removes all
 * added dispose flag to SPWorld
 * cleaned up and removed a couple old unused classes

----------------------------------------------------------------

###Update Version 1.2 Change Log
 * fixed issues with entities hit box collision
 * hit box size wasn't being factored in by pixelMask
 * ported some more properties and methods for hit boxes from flashPunk
 * changed class names to reflect StarlingPunks naming convention

----------------------------------------------------------------

###Update Version 1.1 Change Log
 * Tilemap support
 * Ogmo editor intergration
 * Collision Mask support
 * Grid collision
 * Pixel Mask collision
 * Fixed bug with type only getting set when pass through entity constructor
 * added support for entity depth layers
 * added collideTypes method to entity class
 * misc bug fixes/performance improvements

###Future release plans:
 * Port Camera class
 * Extension for box2D Physics Library
 * Component based behavior system sorta like Unity3D
 * Helper functions for sound effects

###What is StarlingPunk:

StarlingPunk is a framework built on top the Starling library designed to add structure and organization to your 2D game projects. It’s perfect for rapidly prototyping ideas and promotes code reuse between projects.  As you may have been able to tell from the name, StarlingPunk is heavily inspired by the popular FlashPunk framework, although its not a direct port.


### Why StarlingPunk:
* Easily encapsulate code into worlds and entities
* Manages collections of entities based on assigned types
* Fast and easy collision detection system
* All the power of starling performance, sprite sheets, particles, mobile development

### Why build this on top of Starling:
* Best of both worlds allowing us to mix and match regular Starling code with FlashPunk like organization. 
* Fast Stage3D hardware accelerated graphics
* Provides a familiar structure for Actionscript developers
* Harness the power of the display-list, worlds and entities extend the starling sprite class meaning display objects can be nested within them
* Pre-existing Starling code can easily be incorporated into the framework
* Starling already does a ton of things right, sprite-sheet animation, events, dynamic resolutions
* Tons of tools and extensions will already work, like sprite-manager and particles

### Planned future releases:
* Integration with the Nape physics library
* Helper functions for sound effects
* Port Debug console
